# Proposal
Since the introduction of the computer, the way students have taken notes in school has progressed rapidly. Education long used the classic paper and pencil combination as the most effective note taking method, but paper and pencil have its limitations. It can be slow and ineffective in some areas such as graphing. Over the past 2 decades, many companies and people have challenged this established method of note taking. Starting with simple text editors like Microsoft Word and all the way up to the current, highly customizable, options like Notability or Notion. These applications give massive amounts of customization to the way students can organize their notes and work. However, despite the many applications on the market, it can still be hard to find a way to take notes in STEM classes effectively with all the many notations, variables, greek letters, and graphs. This is where we step in.

We would like to create a Notion like application designed around STEM. This application will allow quick access to things such as the greek alphabet, graphs, certain notation, code snippets, etc. It will do this through plug-ins. While online, the application will include all features. When offline, we will allow the download of desired plug-ins for only the features you want so the application will be lighter weight. This will allow the user to take STEM notes quickly while allowing them to use proper notation in their notes so it can make more sense when it is being read back.

## Title
NFTS, aka Notes For Tech Students. We picked this name as our product's goal is to help STEM students write better notes.

## Target Problem & Audience
The target problem is the limited access to STEM based notation and tools in today's note taking applications. For instance, many STEM students need to write formulas or draw graphs for their math classes; however, note applications do not offer a way to accurately represent these figures. Instead students are expected to draw the diagrams themselves. Through our application, STEM students should be able to easily and accurately represent those figures.

## General Features
The application allows STEM students to easily install the needed plugins to help write their notes. For instance, plugins will include in greek lettering, inputting graphs, adding accurate code snippets, LaTeX support, basic shapes, formatting for lab notes. Additionally, students will be able to easily share their notes with another user.
